### Instructions

1. **Sauté the Minced Pork and Onion:**
   - Set the Ninja Foodi to the sauté function and heat the olive oil.

   - Add oregano, basil, salt, and pepper to the pork mixture. Stir well to combine the flavors.

3. **Add Spaghetti and Sauce:**
   - Break the spaghetti in half and lay it evenly over the browned pork.
   - Pour the bottle of spaghetti sauce over the spaghetti.
   - Add 1 liter of water to the pot, ensuring the spaghetti is fully covered.

4. **Pressure Cook:**
   - Secure the lid on the Ninja Foodi, and set it to pressure cook on high for 5 minutes.
   - Once the timer is up, perform a quick release of the pressure.

5. **Stir and Serve:**
   - Open the lid and stir the spaghetti and bolognese sauce together until well combined.
   - If the sauce is too thick, you can add a little water to reach your desired consistency.

6. **Garnish:**
