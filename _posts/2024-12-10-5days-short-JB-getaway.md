## 5 Days in Johor Bahru with Kids

We recently took a 5-day trip to Johor Bahru (JB) with our two kids, and it turned out to be a fun-filled family getaway. Here’s a recap of our adventures, where we balanced kids’ activities, family meals, and a bit of downtime for the adults.

### Day 1: Arrival and Paradigm Mall Fun
We set off on our drive to JB early in the morning and arrived just in time for lunch at **Paradigm Mall**. The mall is huge, with tons of food options and activities to explore. After a satisfying lunch, we checked into our AirBNB which is just above Paradigm mall (Paradigm Residences) and took a much-needed break — bathed the kids, and squeezed in a quick nap to recharge.  
For dinner, we kept things simple and grabbed a meal at a nearby restaurant, saving our energy for the days ahead.

### Day 2: Dim Sum and Baby Shark Playground
We started the day with a hearty breakfast at **Tasixi Dimsum**, where the kids enjoyed picking out different dim sum dishes. From shrimp dumplings to egg tarts, everyone left satisfied. After breakfast, it was off to the **Baby Shark Playground**, a hit with the kids who spent hours climbing, sliding, and bouncing around.  
For dinner, we met up with family and enjoyed a **Zi Char feast** at **Teck Sing**, famous for its paper-wrapped chicken. The kids had their fill of rice and veggies while the adults indulged in a variety of delicious stir-fried dishes.

### Day 3: Brunch, Relaxation, and Peking Duck Dinner
Our Friday started with another dim sum brunch, alternating between **Tasixi** and **Pin Ming Xuan**, both known for their great selections. The kids loved the bao buns and prawn dumplings. After brunch, we took a more relaxed approach with some free-and-easy time.  
While the kids rested, I managed to sneak away for a relaxing massage—much-needed after all the running around! We ended the day with a delightful dinner at **Peking Restaurant**, where the star dish was, of course, the Peking duck. The crispy skin and tender meat were a highlight for everyone.

### Day 4: Food, Fun, and Night Market
Our second-to-last day was all about indulgence! We started with a late breakfast and then headed to **Toppen Mall** for a bit of shopping and to check out another indoor playground for the kids. They had a blast climbing through obstacle courses while we relaxed with coffee from **HWC Cafe**.  
For lunch and dinner, we decided to mix it up with a **hotpot** and **KBBQ** combo, letting the kids get involved with cooking at the table. Later, we strolled through a nearby night market, soaking in the lively atmosphere while grabbing street snacks for dessert.

### Day 5: Wrapping Up and Heading Home
On our final day, we grabbed a quick breakfast and made one last stop at **Chucky Cat Cafe**, where the kids enjoyed playing with the friendly cats. It was a cute and cozy way to end our JB trip. Afterward, we packed up and made the drive back home, already reminiscing about the fun we had over the last five days.

### Bonus Activities We Loved:
- **Chucky Cat Cafe**: Perfect for animal-loving kids.
- **Diggersite**: A fun hands-on experience where kids can operate mini-excavators.
- **Baking Class**: A great activity that lets the kids get creative while learning.
- **Dog or Rabbit Cafe**: A hit with our kids, who loved playing with the animals.
- **Ma Maison Tonkatsu at Mid Valley**: A great spot for lunch with delicious tonkatsu.

Johor Bahru proved to be a fantastic family-friendly destination, offering a mix of fun for the kids, good food, and relaxation. We can’t wait to go back!
