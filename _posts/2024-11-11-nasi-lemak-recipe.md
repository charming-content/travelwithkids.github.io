### Instructions

1. **Cook the Coconut Rice:**
   - In a rice cooker or pot, combine the rinsed rice, coconut milk, water, pandan leaves, ginger, and salt.
   - Cook the rice as you would normally, ensuring it becomes fluffy and fragrant. Once done, remove pandan leaves and ginger.

2. **Prepare the Sambal:**
   - Blend dried chilies, fresh chilies, shallots, garlic, and shrimp paste into a smooth paste using a food processor.
   - Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the blended paste and fry until fragrant, about 5-7 minutes.
   - Add tamarind paste, sugar, and salt. Simmer on low heat for 10-15 minutes until the sambal thickens. Set aside.

3. **Prepare the Accompaniments:**
   - Fry the anchovies in hot oil until crispy. Set aside on a paper towel.
   - Boil the eggs, peel, and cut them in half.
   - Roast the peanuts in a dry pan until lightly browned.

4. **Assemble the Nasi Lemak:**
   - Serve a scoop of coconut rice on a plate.
   - Add a spoonful of sambal on the side.
   - Arrange the fried anchovies, roasted peanuts, boiled egg halves, and cucumber slices around the rice.
   - Optionally, serve with fried chicken or rendang for a more hearty meal.
