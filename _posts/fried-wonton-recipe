### Instructions

1. **Prepare the Filling:**
   - In a large bowl, combine ground pork (or chicken), minced garlic, diced water chestnut, spring onions, soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil, white pepper, and cornstarch.
   - Mix thoroughly until the ingredients are well combined. If the mixture feels dry, add an egg for moisture and binding.

2. **Wrap the Wontons:**
   - Place a small spoonful of the filling in the center of each wonton wrapper.
   - Wet the edges of the wrapper with water using your finger.
   - Fold the wrapper into a triangle, pressing the edges together to seal. You can also fold the two ends of the triangle together to make a classic wonton shape.

3. **Heat the Oil:**
   - In a deep pan or wok, heat vegetable oil over medium heat until it reaches 180°C (350°F). You can test the oil by dropping a small piece of wonton wrapper in; if it sizzles and floats, it's ready.

4. **Fry the Wontons:**
   - Gently lower the wontons into the hot oil, frying in batches to avoid overcrowding.
   - Fry for 3-4 minutes, turning occasionally, until they are golden brown and crispy.
   - Remove the wontons with a slotted spoon and drain on a paper towel.

5. **Prepare the Dipping Sauce (Optional):**
   - In a small bowl, mix soy sauce, rice vinegar, chili oil, and sugar until well combined.

6. **Serve:**
   - Serve the fried wontons hot with your dipping sauce of choice.
