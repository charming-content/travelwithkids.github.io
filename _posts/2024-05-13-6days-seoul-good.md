## CharMing's 6 Days Seoul Good with Kids

Our family trip to Seoul was packed with excitement and discovery. Traveling with two kids can be challenging, but Seoul's kid-friendly attractions and vibrant culture made for an unforgettable adventure. Here's a look at our 6-day itinerary.

### Day 1: Arrival in Seoul and Dinner at Hongdae
We flew into Seoul from Jeju and arrived just in time for dinner at **Hongdae**, one of the most lively neighborhoods in the city. For our first meal, we indulged in **BBQ chicken** and **oven-baked chicken** at **Boseung Hall**. The kids loved the bustling energy of the area, and it was a great way to kick off our trip.

### Day 2: Gwangjang Market, Hanok Villages, and Gyeongbokgung Palace
We started the day with a brunch at **Gwangjang Market**, famous for its street food. We had to try the **Netflix-famous noodle stand**, which didn’t disappoint. Afterward, we wandered through **Ikseondong Hanok Village**, a beautiful area filled with traditional Korean houses and quaint cafes. The kids enjoyed the unique vibes at **Soha Salt Pond Cafe**.

Next, we headed to **Anguk**, where we visited **Cafe Onion** and the trendy **London Bagel Museum** for some light snacks. Our afternoon was spent at **Gyeongbokgung Palace**, exploring the beautiful grounds and learning about Korean history. We ended our day with a hearty meal of **Tosokchon ginseng chicken soup**, which was surprisingly a hit with the kids!

### Day 3: Nami Island Day Tour
We took a full-day tour of **Nami Island**, a serene escape from the city. The ferry ride itself was exciting for the kids, and they had a blast cycling through the island and exploring its wide open spaces. The natural beauty and sculptures around the island made it a perfect spot for family photos.

After returning to Seoul, we grabbed dinner back in **Hongdae**, revisiting our favorite spots for some comfort food after a long day.

### Day 4: Noryangjin Market, Garosugil, and BBQ Dinner
We started the day with a seafood brunch at **Noryangjin Market**, where we picked fresh seafood and had it cooked on-site. The kids loved seeing all the fish and crabs, and the grilled seafood was delicious.

Afterward, we explored **Garosugil**, a chic neighborhood known for its shopping and trendy cafes. We stopped by **Nudake Cafe** for dessert, followed by a relaxing lunch at **Sinsajeon** where we tried honeycomb makgeoli and savory pancakes. For dinner, we headed to **Ggupdang BBQ**, one of the most popular BBQ joints in the area. Pro tip: get your queue number early, as this place fills up fast!

### Day 5: N Seoul Tower, MyeongDong Shopping, and Nanta Show
We kicked off the day with breakfast, then headed up to **N Seoul Tower** for breathtaking panoramic views of the city. The kids were fascinated by the locks of love and enjoyed the cable car ride. 

In the afternoon, we ventured to **MyeongDong** for shopping and lunch at **Andong Jimdak** and **MyeongDong Gyoja**, both offering family-friendly menus. After a bit of retail therapy, we caught the **Nanta Show**—a hilarious non-verbal performance that had both adults and kids laughing out loud.

To wrap up the day, we did some late-night shopping at **Lotte Mart**, stocking up on Korean snacks to bring home.

### Day 6: Farewell to Seoul
On our last morning, we enjoyed a leisurely breakfast before checking out of our Airbnb. We left our luggage at the property and spent our final hours exploring the nearby area. With our flight at 4:45 PM, we had plenty of time for some last-minute shopping and a quick stop at **Starfield Coex Mall**, where the kids were mesmerized by the aquarium and the stunning library.

Our 6-day trip to Seoul was packed with fun, food, and family-friendly experiences. From cultural landmarks to delicious meals, there was never a dull moment. We can’t wait to visit Seoul again!
