### Instructions

1. **Make the Pork Sauce:**
   - Heat olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, carrot, and celery. Sauté for 5-7 minutes until softened.
   - Add the minced pork and cook until browned, breaking it up as it cooks.
   - Stir in tomato paste and cook for 2 minutes.
   - Add crushed tomatoes, white wine (or chicken stock), sugar, thyme, and basil. Season with salt and pepper.
   - Simmer on low heat for 30-40 minutes, stirring occasionally.

2. **Prepare the Béchamel Sauce:**
   - Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the flour and whisk for 1-2 minutes to create a roux.
   - Gradually add the warm milk while whisking continuously. Cook until the sauce thickens, about 5-7 minutes.
   - Season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg. Set aside.

3. **Preheat the Oven:**
   - Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F).

4. **Assemble the Lasagna:**
   - In a greased baking dish, start with a layer of pork sauce.
   - Add a layer of lasagna sheets.
   - Spread a layer of béchamel sauce and sprinkle with mozzarella and Parmesan.
   - Repeat the layers (pork sauce, lasagna sheets, béchamel, cheese) until you've used all the ingredients, finishing with béchamel and cheese on top.

5. **Bake the Lasagna:**
   - Cover with foil and bake for 25 minutes.
   - Remove the foil and bake for an additional 20-25 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbly.

6. **Rest and Serve:**
   - Let the lasagna rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing.
   - Garnish with fresh parsley, if desired.
