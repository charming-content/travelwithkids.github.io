## 10 Days in Taipei and Yilan with Kids

Our recent family trip to Taipei and Yilan was filled with adventure, excitement, and lots of fun moments with our two little ones. Here’s a glimpse into our 10-day itinerary exploring these vibrant parts of Taiwan.

### Day 1: Arrival in Taipei
We landed in Taipei and headed straight to our hotel. After settling in, we took a leisurely walk around **Ximending**, a bustling area full of street food, shops, and entertainment. The kids were thrilled with the colorful street performers.

### Day 2: Taipei Zoo and Maokong Gondola
We started the day at the **Taipei Zoo**, which was a hit with the kids. They loved seeing the pandas, elephants, and reptiles. In the afternoon, we rode the **Maokong Gondola** up the mountain. The kids loved the glass-bottom gondola, and the views of Taipei from above were stunning.

### Day 3: National Palace Museum and Shilin Night Market
The **National Palace Museum** was a bit more relaxed but still fascinating. We took the kids through the children's gallery, where they had interactive displays. In the evening, we headed to **Shilin Night Market** for some delicious street food. The fried chicken and bubble tea were the highlights!

### Day 4: Taipei 101 and Elephant Mountain
A visit to **Taipei 101** was an absolute must! We zoomed up to the observation deck, where the panoramic view of Taipei wowed us. Later, we hiked up **Elephant Mountain** for another great view of the city at sunset. The kids did well on the short but steep trail.

### Day 5: Day Trip to Beitou Hot Springs
We took a day trip to **Beitou**, famous for its hot springs. While we couldn’t stay long in the hot pools with the kids, they had a blast playing in the public foot baths. The **Thermal Valley** was also a fun and educational stop where we learned about the region's volcanic activity.

### Day 6: Travel to Yilan
We packed up and headed to **Yilan**, just a short train ride from Taipei. After checking into a family-friendly resort, we explored the **Jiaoxi Hot Springs** area. The kids loved playing in the warm pools, and we found a nearby park with playgrounds to relax for the evening.

### Day 7: Dongshan River Water Park and Luodong Night Market
We spent the day at **Dongshan River Water Park**, which had plenty of fun activities for the kids, including paddle boats and water play areas. In the evening, we explored **Luodong Night Market**, where we indulged in local snacks like green onion pancakes and grilled seafood.

### Day 8: Kavalan Distillery and Jimmy Park
While Yilan is known for its family attractions, we also took a quick visit to the **Kavalan Distillery**, where the adults got to enjoy a tasting. Later, we visited **Jimmy Park**, a whimsical outdoor art space inspired by the local artist Jimmy Liao. The kids enjoyed climbing on the playful sculptures.

### Day 9: Toucheng Farm and Lanyang Museum
We spent the day at **Toucheng Farm**, where the kids got to feed animals, pick fruits, and learn about traditional Taiwanese farming. In the afternoon, we visited the **Lanyang Museum**, a beautifully designed building that showcases the history and culture of Yilan. It was a great mix of fun and education.

### Day 10: Return to Taipei and Departure
On our last day, we returned to Taipei for some final souvenir shopping and lunch at the airport, nothing fanciful but it was convenient. Overall even though we encountered **typhoon Krathon*" during our stay there, it was still an enjoyable and relaxing holiday for us!

Stay tuned for more of our family travels! Taipei and Yilan were incredibly kid-friendly, making our trip both enjoyable and memorable.
