## CharMing 10 Days in Taipei and Yilan with Kids: Encountering Typhoon Krathon

Our recent family trip to Taipei and Yilan was filled with adventure (Typhoon Krathon), excitement, and lots of fun moments with our two little ones. Here’s a glimpse into our 10-day itinerary exploring these vibrant parts of Taiwan.

### Day 1: Arrival in Taipei
We landed in Taipei and headed straight to our **Cosmos hotel** which is just beside Taipei Main statoon, very convenient. After settling in, we took MRT to **Ximending** which is just one stop away, XMD is a bustling area full of street food, shops, and entertainment. The kids were thrilled with the colorful street performers and claw machines.

### Day 2: Taipei Zoo and Maokong Gondola
We started the day at the **Taipei Zoo**, which was a hit with the kids. They loved seeing the pandas, elephants, and reptiles. In the afternoon, we rode the **Maokong Gondola** up the mountain. The kids loved the glass-bottom gondola, and the views of Taipei from above were stunning. We are lucky that we visited this place on day 2 as the Typhoon warning came just a few days later which closed the **Maokong Gondola**.

### Day 3: National Palace Museum and Shilin Night Market
The **National Palace Museum** was a bit more relaxed but still fascinating. We took the kids through the children's gallery, where they had interactive displays. In the evening, we headed to **Shilin Night Market** for some delicious street food. The fried chicken and bubble tea were the highlights!

### Day 4: Taipei 101 and Elephant Mountain
A visit to **Taipei 101** was an absolute must! We zoomed up to the observation deck, where the panoramic view of Taipei wowed us. Later, we hiked up **Elephant Mountain** for another great view of the city at sunset. The kids did well on the short but steep trail.

### Day 5: Day Trip to Beitou Hot Springs
We took a day trip to **Beitou**, famous for its hot springs. While we couldn’t stay long in the hot pools with the kids, they had a blast playing in the public foot baths. The **Thermal Valley** was also a fun and educational stop where we learned about the region's volcanic activity.

### Day 6: Day Trip to Yilan
We 包车 for a day (around 3000twd) and headed to **Yilan**, we went to the **Zhang Mei Ama's Farm** before having lunch at the **Red Lantern Restaurant**. We explored the **Jiaoxi Hot Springs** area later in the evening. The kids loved playing in the warm pools, and we found a nearby park with playgrounds to relax for the evening. After that we went back to our hotel in Taipei.

### Day 7: Dongshan River Water Park and Luodong Night Market
We spent the day at **Dongshan River Water Park**, which had plenty of fun activities for the kids, including paddle boats and water play areas. In the evening, we explored **Luodong Night Market**, where we indulged in local snacks like green onion pancakes and grilled seafood.

### Day 8: Kavalan Distillery and Jimmy Park
While Yilan is known for its family attractions, we also took a quick visit to the **Kavalan Distillery**, where the adults got to enjoy a tasting. Later, we visited **Jimmy Park**, a whimsical outdoor art space inspired by the local artist Jimmy Liao. The kids enjoyed climbing on the playful sculptures.

### Day 9: Toucheng Farm and Lanyang Museum
We spent the day at **Toucheng Farm**, where the kids got to feed animals, pick fruits, and learn about traditional Taiwanese farming. In the afternoon, we visited the **Lanyang Museum**, a beautifully designed building that showcases the history and culture of Yilan. It was a great mix of fun and education.

### Day 10: Return to Taipei and Departure
On our last day, we returned to Taipei for some final souvenir shopping and lunch at the airport, nothing fanciful but it was convenient. Overall even though we encountered **typhoon Krathon*" during our stay there, it was still an enjoyable and relaxing holiday for us!

Stay tuned for more of our family travels! Taipei and Yilan were incredibly kid-friendly, making our trip both enjoyable and memorable.
