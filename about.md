Hi, we are the CharMing family from Singapore. We loved exploring new cultures, enjoying nice food, and experiencing the beauty of different countries together with our 2 kids. This travel blog is a place for us to share our stories/tips/itineraries as we travel the world with our kids!

Feel free to follow along and leave comments or questions!
