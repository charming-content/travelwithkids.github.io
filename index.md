Hi, We are the CharMing family, and this is our travel blog where we share my experiences from exploring the world with our kids. From the bustling streets of Taipei to the serene beaches of Malaysia, We will take you on a journey to discover new food places, cultures, and adventures. Tips and lessons learned so that you will not repeat our mistakes :)

We also love to cook, experimenting with different flavors and ingredients to create delicious meals that bring joy to our table. Cooking has become a passion for us, and we're excited to share our favorite recipes with you. Whether you're looking for quick weeknight dinners, comforting weekend meals, or something special for a celebration, we hope our collection of recipes will inspire you to get creative in your own kitchen. Letâ€™s cook together and enjoy the magic of home-cooked meals!
